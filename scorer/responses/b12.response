 <COREF ID="1" REF="X2">Communications Satellite Corp., Washington</COREF>, said <COREF ID="3" REF="X12">it</COREF> submitted to the <COREF ID="X16" REF="1">Federal Communications Commission</COREF> a proposal to reduce by 50% rates for certain international telecommunication services. 


 In exchange for the <COREF ID="X22" REF="12">reductions</COREF>, customers such as <COREF ID="X26" REF="X9">American Telephone @amp</COREF>; Telegraph Co. would have to commit themselves to using one of two <COREF ID="X31">new types of digital satellite services</COREF> for a 10-year period, <COREF ID="4" REF="5">Comsat</COREF> said. 


 The proposal is part of a multi-year agreement between <COREF ID="5" REF="4">Comsat</COREF> and <COREF ID="6" REF="10">AT@amp;T</COREF> that guarantees <COREF ID="7" REF="5">Comsat</COREF> a portion of <COREF ID="8" REF="X26">the telephone company</COREF>'s international business in the face of growing competition from fiber-optic cables. 


 <COREF ID="9" REF="7">Comsat</COREF> said <COREF ID="10" REF="6">AT@amp;T</COREF> and other customers would be able to convert gradually to <COREF ID="11" REF="X31">the new digital service</COREF> beginning next year, and that by 1994, as much as 83% of a customer's international circuits could qualify for <COREF ID="12" REF="X22">the price reductions</COREF>. 


 <COREF ID="13" REF="11">Digital service</COREF> allows telecommunications customers to subdivide satellite circuits to handle more than one message at a time, <COREF ID="14" REF="9">Comsat</COREF> said.
