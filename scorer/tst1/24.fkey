 <COREF ID="135" REF="X1">Gitano Group Inc. President Haim Dabah</COREF> likes to think of <COREF ID="2" REF="135">his</COREF> company as "<COREF ID="X4">the Liz Claiborne</COREF> of <COREF ID="4" REF="X2">the masses</COREF>." 


 While <COREF ID="5" REF="X4">Liz Claiborne Inc.</COREF> and other high-fashion womenswear makers sell <COREF ID="X5">their</COREF> clothes through <COREF ID="X6">department</COREF> stores and pricey boutiques, <COREF ID="6" REF="2">Gitano</COREF>'s market is distinctly middle American. 
 <COREF ID="7" REF="6">Its</COREF> outlets are <COREF ID="X7">mass merchandisers</COREF> and <COREF ID="X8">discount</COREF> chains such as K mart Corp. and <COREF ID="X9">Wal-Mart Stores Inc.</COREF> 


 But like <COREF ID="8" REF="X5">its more glamorous competitors</COREF>, <COREF ID="10" REF="7">Gitano</COREF> puts heavy emphasis on advertising and promotion to create a <COREF ID="X10">fashion</COREF> image for <COREF ID="X11">its clothes</COREF>. 
 In fact, company focus groups indicate <COREF ID="X12">Gitano customers</COREF> associate <COREF ID="13" REF="10">the brand</COREF> with fashionable department stores like Bloomingdale's and Neiman-Marcus even though <COREF ID="14" REF="13">it</COREF>'s primarily sold through <COREF ID="15" REF="X7">mass merchandisers</COREF>. 


 That perception has been credited to <COREF ID="16" REF="135">Mr. Dabah</COREF>, who "has a great flair for marketing and presentation," says <COREF ID="X13">Stanley Greenstein, </COREF><COREF ID="18" REF="X13">Gitano chief financial officer</COREF>. 


 <COREF ID="20" REF="10">Gitano</COREF>'s <COREF ID="X38">marketing</COREF> strategy seems to be paying off. 
 While much of the <COREF ID="X14">apparel</COREF> industry is in the doldrums, <COREF ID="22" REF="20">Gitano</COREF> is posting big increases in revenue and earnings. 
 <COREF ID="X15">Monday</COREF>, <COREF ID="23" REF="22">the company</COREF> said <COREF ID="X16">third-quarter earnings</COREF> jumped 62.2% to <COREF ID="24" REF="X16">$4.1 million</COREF> on <COREF ID="X17">sales of $119.1 million</COREF>. 


 <COREF ID="X18">Its stock, which was priced at $20.50 a share when the company went public on Sept. 30,</COREF> dropped <COREF ID="X19">a total of $2</COREF> on <COREF ID="29" REF="X15">Monday</COREF> and Tuesday. 
 But analysts didn't see any significance in the drop, since <COREF ID="30" REF="X18">it</COREF>'s a relatively new issue and <COREF ID="31" REF="30">it</COREF>'s thinly traded -- <COREF ID="32" REF="16">Mr. Dabah</COREF> and <COREF ID="33" REF="32">his</COREF> family still control 78% of <COREF ID="34" REF="23">the company</COREF>. 
 Yesterday <COREF ID="35" REF="31">the stock</COREF> gained 12.5 cents to close at $15.875 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 


 <COREF ID="X20">Norman G. Fosback, </COREF><COREF ID="36" REF="X20">editor</COREF> of New Issues, an investment newsletter, notes that <COREF ID="X21">investors, familiar with the up-and-down cycles on Seventh Avenue,</COREF> may be skeptical as to whether <COREF ID="37" REF="34">Gitano</COREF> can fly any higher. 
 "<COREF ID="38" REF="X21">One</COREF> wonders how long can <COREF ID="39" REF="37">they</COREF> go on like this," <COREF ID="40" REF="36">he</COREF> says. 


 <COREF ID="41" REF="X9">Wal-Mart, of Bentonville, Ark.,</COREF> says that in the two years <COREF ID="42" REF="41">it</COREF> has carried <COREF ID="43" REF="14">the brand</COREF>, <COREF ID="44" REF="39">Gitano</COREF> has grown to become <COREF ID="45" REF="44">one</COREF> of its top apparel resources, selling "better than others in the same price range."
 <COREF ID="48" REF="42">WalMart</COREF> attributes <COREF ID="49" REF="44">Gitano</COREF>'s success to <COREF ID="50" REF="49">its</COREF> high-profile <COREF ID="51" REF="X38">marketing</COREF> techniques and close monitoring of <COREF ID="X22">sales</COREF> trends. 


 <COREF ID="52" REF="33">Mr. Dabah</COREF> "firmly believes that after you sell to the retailer, <COREF ID="X23">it</COREF>'s just <COREF ID="53" REF="X23">the beginning</COREF>," <COREF ID="54" REF="18">Mr. Greenstein</COREF> says. 


 For example, <COREF ID="55" REF="X8">discount</COREF> stores are strictly self-service, so <COREF ID="56" REF="50">Gitano</COREF> attaches big, colored tags on <COREF ID="57" REF="X11">clothes</COREF> to show <COREF ID="58" REF="X12">customers</COREF> how <COREF ID="59" REF="58">they</COREF> can fashionably pair <COREF ID="X24">tops</COREF> and <COREF ID="X25">bottoms</COREF>, a tactic that also induces multiple sales. 


 <COREF ID="60" REF="52">Mr. Dabah, a vivacious salesman,</COREF> compares <COREF ID="61" REF="60">himself</COREF> to "a baseball player coming to work." 
 <COREF ID="62" REF="61">He</COREF> relishes cooking up new <COREF ID="63" REF="51">marketing</COREF> strategies, listing such projects as mail-in rebates and gift certificates with a purchase. 
 In the past three years, <COREF ID="64" REF="56">the company</COREF> also held a nationwide "<COREF ID="65" REF="64">Gitano</COREF> Girl" model-search contest. 
 At <COREF ID="X26">Bradlees stores</COREF>, <COREF ID="66" REF="64">Gitano</COREF> recently sponsored a <COREF ID="67" REF="X22">sales</COREF> contest for department managers with prizes like trips to Club Med and color televisions. 
 The result: <COREF ID="68" REF="67">sales of Gitano clothes</COREF> were up 180% at <COREF ID="70" REF="X26">Bradlees</COREF> in one month. 


 As part of <COREF ID="71" REF="62">his</COREF> hectic day, <COREF ID="72" REF="71">Mr. Dabah</COREF> touches base with <COREF ID="73" REF="72">his</COREF> brothers, <COREF ID="X27">Isaac, </COREF><COREF ID="74" REF="X27">the company's vice chairman, who oversees Gitano's production at its factories in 31 countries,</COREF> and <COREF ID="X28">Ezra, </COREF><COREF ID="79" REF="X28">president of Gitano's children's wear division</COREF>. 


 <COREF ID="81" REF="73">Mr. Dabah, whose father Morris -- chairman of the company -- founded Gitano 17 years ago after emigrating from Israel,</COREF> says a major reason <COREF ID="86" REF="44">the company</COREF> sells through <COREF ID="87" REF="15">mass merchandisers</COREF> is because it's easier to keep <COREF ID="X29">costs</COREF> down. 
 <COREF ID="88" REF="86">Gitano</COREF>'s staple products -- <COREF ID="89" REF="X24">tops</COREF> and <COREF ID="90" REF="X25">bottoms for women that sell for around $20</COREF> -- don't have "major <COREF ID="91" REF="X10">fashion</COREF> risks," <COREF ID="92" REF="81">he</COREF> says. 
 That means <COREF ID="93" REF="88">Gitano</COREF> can commit to <COREF ID="X30">styles</COREF> months ahead of when <COREF ID="94" REF="X30">they</COREF>'re needed and keep <COREF ID="95" REF="93">its</COREF> factory contractors operating in slack periods. 


 <COREF ID="97" REF="95">Gitano</COREF> also has the luxury of always shipping <COREF ID="98" REF="57">its goods</COREF> by sea instead of air. 
 Any sudden <COREF ID="100" REF="91">fashion</COREF> shift won't reach <COREF ID="X31">the mass market</COREF> until a season or two later, anyway. 
 The <COREF ID="101" REF="X29">cost</COREF> savings can be passed on to <COREF ID="102" REF="97">Gitano</COREF>'s retailers, allowing <COREF ID="103" REF="102">the company</COREF>, for example, to keep the wholesale price of <COREF ID="104" REF="103">its</COREF> jeans at $10 when "Lee is at $15.75 to $16.50," <COREF ID="105" REF="92">Mr. Dabah</COREF> says. 


 <COREF ID="106" REF="104">The company</COREF> works to keep <COREF ID="107" REF="101">its costs</COREF> down in other areas, too. 
 Two years ago, <COREF ID="109" REF="105">Mr. Dabah</COREF> shifted the responsibility for <COREF ID="110" REF="106">the company</COREF>'s extensive print and television advertising to an in-house staff, enabling <COREF ID="111" REF="110">Gitano</COREF> to get more mileage from <COREF ID="112" REF="111">its</COREF> annual $15 million advertising budget. 


 <COREF ID="113" REF="112">Gitano</COREF> has pulled off a clever illusion with <COREF ID="X32">its advertising</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="115" REF="X32">The campaign</COREF> gives <COREF ID="116" REF="57">its clothes</COREF> a youthful and trendy image to lure <COREF ID="118" REF="59">consumers</COREF> into the store. 
 But most of the clothes are actually cut to fit more mature bodies. 
 Most of <COREF ID="119" REF="113">Gitano</COREF>'s fans are aging baby boomers, and some of <COREF ID="120" REF="43">the brand</COREF>'s top sellers are maternity clothes and jeans for larger-sized women. 


 <COREF ID="121" REF="109">Mr. Dabah</COREF>'s <COREF ID="X33">expansion</COREF> plans include opening more <COREF ID="122" REF="119">Gitano</COREF> retail outlets; there are currently 35. 
 Capitalizing on <COREF ID="123" REF="122">Gitano</COREF>'s fashion image, <COREF ID="124" REF="123">the company</COREF> also is rolling out <COREF ID="X34">a more expensive brand</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="125" REF="X34">Linea Gitano, a new sportswear collection priced from $35 to $70,</COREF> recently began selling exclusively in <COREF ID="126" REF="X6">department</COREF> and specialty stores. 


 But <COREF ID="127" REF="121">Mr. Dabah</COREF> says <COREF ID="128" REF="127">his</COREF> major focus will continue to be <COREF ID="129" REF="X31">the mass market</COREF>. 
 One area of <COREF ID="130" REF="X33">expansion</COREF> will be licensing agreements with other <COREF ID="131" REF="X14">apparel</COREF> companies. 
 This year, for example, <COREF ID="X35">Playtex Apparel Inc.</COREF> licensed <COREF ID="132" REF="120">the Gitano label</COREF> for a line of fashion bras in the $6 to $8 range to complement <COREF ID="133" REF="X35">Playtex</COREF>'s basic $15 bras. 
 "The sales have been tremendous so far," says <COREF ID="X36">Paul Mischinski, </COREF><COREF ID="134" REF="X36">marketing director of Playtex's Gitano brand</COREF>. 
 Says <COREF ID="137" REF="134">Mr. Mischinski</COREF>: "<COREF ID="138" REF="124">Gitano</COREF> has the total package-<COREF ID="139" REF="59">customer</COREF> awareness, distribution and <COREF ID="140" REF="100">fashion</COREF> leadership."
