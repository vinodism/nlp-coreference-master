 <COREF ID="3">Eastern Airlines</COREF> executives notified union leaders that <COREF ID="-8">the carrier</COREF>wishes to discuss selective wage reductions on <COREF ID="6">Feb. 3</COREF>. 


 Union representatives who could be reached said <COREF ID="8">they</COREF> hadn't decided whether <COREF ID="9">they</COREF> would respond. 


 By proposing <COREF ID="10">a meeting date</COREF>, <COREF ID="11">Eastern</COREF> moved one step closer toward reopening current high-cost contract agreements with <COREF ID="12">its unions</COREF>. 
 The proposal to meet followed an announcement <COREF ID="-15" REF="11">Wednesday</COREF>in which Philip Bakes, <COREF ID="14">Eastern's president</COREF>, laid out proposals to cut wages selectively an average of 29%. 
 <COREF ID="18">The airline</COREF>'s three major labor unions, whose contracts don't expire until year's end at the earliest, have vowed to resist the <COREF ID="19">cuts</COREF>. 


 Nevertheless, one union official said <COREF ID="20">he</COREF> was intrigued by the brief and polite letter, which was hand-delivered by corporate security officers to <COREF ID="21">the unions</COREF>. 
 According to Robert Callahan, <COREF ID="22" REF="6">president of Eastern's flight attendants union</COREF>, the past practice of Eastern's parent, Houston-based <COREF ID="25" REF="-1">Texas Air Corp.</COREF>, has involved confrontation and ultimatums to <COREF ID="26">unions</COREF> either to accept <COREF ID="27" REF="-8">the carrier</COREF>'s terms or to suffer the consequences -- in this case, perhaps, layoffs. 


 "Yesterday's performance was a departure," <COREF ID="28">Mr. Callahan</COREF> said, citing the invitation to conduct broad negotiations -- and the lack of a deadline imposed by management. 
 "Frankly, <COREF ID="29">it</COREF>'s a little mystifying."
